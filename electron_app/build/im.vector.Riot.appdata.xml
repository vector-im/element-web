	<summary>Client for the Matrix network</summary>
	<description>
		<p>
			Riot allows teams to communicate across a wide range of
			collaboration apps. If some team members use Riot while others
			use IRC, Slack or Gitter, Riot will allow these team members to
			seamlessly work together. Riot offers the richest network of
			communication bridges.
		</p>
		<p>
			Riot is built on top of Matrix. Matrix is an open network for
			secure, decentralized communication delivering a community of
			users, bridged networks, integrated bots and applications plus
			full end-to-end encryption.
